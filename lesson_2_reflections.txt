What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git file which will subsequently be used to trakc commits
and history.

We need it because we can't track changes otherwise

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows the user to choose which files should be part of a commit and which shouldn't.
Simply put, it lets the user decide what to keep track of and when.
