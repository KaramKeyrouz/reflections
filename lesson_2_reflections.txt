What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git file which will subsequently be used to trakc commits
and history.

We need it because we can't track changes otherwise

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows the user to choose which files should be part of a commit and which shouldn't.
Simply put, it lets the user decide what to keep track of and when.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By comparing the staging area the added file and the last commit in the repository, the differences
can be checked and located, enabling a user to be sure only 1 logical change was made.

Secondly, by sending only files where the logical change has any effect to the staging are,
this can be ensured.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

-Experimenting with some features
-Making different versions

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams let you see each branch and where they branch out which helps when you want to 
know what changes were/were not made in case you check out that branch.

Also, the diagrams help to know if there is an unreachable commit for which we need to create a branch
or discard.
