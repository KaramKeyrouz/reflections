When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-working from different locations on different terminals
-working in a group with other people
-storage purposes
-enable sharing with other people and get feedback

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Someone else might have uploaded a file that you don't want to pull just yet
-Multiple sources might be pushing on GitHub
-You may only want to pull specific files, not everything
